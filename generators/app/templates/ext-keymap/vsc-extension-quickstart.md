# Welcome to your Azure Data Studio Extension

## What's in the folder
* This folder contains all of the files necessary for your extension pack.
* `package.json` - this is the manifest file that defines the list of keybindings of the extension.

## Get up and running straight away
* Press `F5` to open a new window with your extension loaded.
* Press `Ctrl + .` instead of `Ctrl + Shift + P`
* Verify that it will launch the Command Palette listing all available commands. The `Ctrl + .` keyboard shortcut was added as an example to you.

## Make changes
* You can relaunch the extension from the debug toolbar after making changes to the files listed above.
* You can also reload (`Ctrl+R` or `Cmd+R` on Mac) the Azure Data Studio window with your extension to load your changes.

## Install your extension
* To start using your extension with Azure Data Studio copy it into the `<user home>/.azuredatastudio/extensions` folder and restart Azure Data Studio.
* To share your extension with the world, read on https://github.com/microsoft/azuredatastudio/wiki/Getting-started-with-Extensibility about publishing an extension.
